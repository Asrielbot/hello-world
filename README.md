# hello-world

Hello everyone !

I'm Asrielbot, also known as Asrielobro AKA Asriel. I'm a developer who likes particularly the web development, I'm young and I don't have that much experience, but I'm at ease with HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and frameworks such as bootstrap. I can also make some projects using C and a bit C++.

I'm entertained by football, development, videogames, travelling, and japanese animation / mangas.
